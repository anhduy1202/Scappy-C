  Verify command line args length (Can't be empty)
  parse command line args (url, -h, --help, -b, -B, -o, -O, -d)
  parse url into parts ( uri, protocol, site)
  Check valid protocol ( http only, no https)
  if protocol is empty
    protcol = http

  if path is empty
    path = "/"

  if LOOKS LIKE IP ADDRESS ( host) is FALSE
    CONVERT HOST TO IP ADDRESS( host, ip_address)

  HTTP FETCH AND PRINT ( ip_address, path )

  exit



CONVERT HOST TO IP ADDRESS ( host string, ip address )
  - Set up the hints structure to specify that we want an IPv4 address and a stream (TCP) socket
  -  Call getaddrinfo() to resolve the host name to an IP address
  - Loop through the results and use the first one we can connect to
  - Convert the IP address to a string and copy it to the output buffer
  - Return the ip address if found

PARSE URL INTO PARTS:
  /*
  http://www.doublepup.com/ip.txt
  - protocol
  - host
  - path
  <anything up to :// > - protocol
  <anything up to / >  host
  <slash AND anything after it> - path

  */

bool LOOKS LIKE IP ADDRESS ( hostname )
  - Use the inet_pton() to convert IP address to binary expression
  return true if ip valid, else return false

HTTP FETCH AND PRINT (server_address, page )
  create socket
  connect to server_address
  write GET request for "page"--- using HTTP
  read response --- using HTTP

  if response code is 2xx
    print response text
  eles if response code i 3xx
    print redirect to host site
  else
    print code as error message
  close socket
